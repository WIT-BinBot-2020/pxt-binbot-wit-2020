```

3. Make your own branch to start developing your functionality

```
git checkout -b branchName
```

### Finishing the Branch

When done your implementation for the branch, send the branch details and the functionality implemented to [andyAndyA](https://github.com/andyAndyA) to check for any potential merge conflicts.
